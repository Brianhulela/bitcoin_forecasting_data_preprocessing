# Bitcoin Price Feature Engineering and Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing historical Bitcoin price data using Python. It explores a range of technical indicators and statistical features commonly used in financial analysis, including daily returns, moving averages, Bollinger Bands, RSI, and volatility.

The analysis includes:

- Data extraction using `yfinance`
- Feature engineering for common trading signals
- Clear, informative visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- A correlation heatmap to assess relationships between engineered features

All plots are saved for easy reference, and the processed dataset is exported for further use in modeling or analysis.
